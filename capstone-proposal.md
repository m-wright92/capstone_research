Name of Student: Mike Wright 

Name of Project: WIP

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) Connect programmers in a place where they can share and discuss code. Like stackoverflow as a social media site

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: Crete user accounts, connect with out users/add friends, crete/edit profiles, basic feed of connections

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific: Ruby, Rails, Postgresql, React

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific: Direct messages, post/interact with others posts eg comment/react, ability to share code snippets/images, ability to create groups and invite other users, connect other accounts like GH.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require? I believe all of this functionality can be accomplished with the use of ruby gems, but I will need to research how to connect account to a github account and what requirements that will need.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know? nope
